## Introduction

<img src="assets\images\Bashar.jpg" alt="1337bash Photo" title="1337bash Photo" hspace="25" width="40%" align="right"/> My name is Bashar, AKA 133bash. I have a lot of passion for information security. This blog is my first step to contribute back to the community. I sincerely hope you will find something useful in my blog. Whether if it will help with your job or your career or even for pure amusement, I will try to share my knowledge and expertise with you and welcome your feedback.

I am interested in all areas of Information Security. You can't defend your organization or infrastructure properly if you don't understand how the attackers can get in and move round. In the same time, you have to understand what the blue team is monitoring and looking for to avoid being caught and stay under the radar if you want to get those invaluable domain admin creds. it is two sides of the same coin.
